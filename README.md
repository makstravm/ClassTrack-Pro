# Introduce

Introducing our user-friendly application designed to streamline your class management experience, whether it's English or any other subject.

Our app simplifies the process of staying organized by effortlessly keeping track of your classes. You can easily monitor the number of lessons, their dates, and the associated payments.

The app features a convenient balance calculator that provides real-time financial insights. Gain a clear overview of your expenses by tracking your spending, knowing the current cost per lesson, and understanding your available funds or outstanding debts. The app also highlights any unpaid lessons for your attention.

What sets us apart is our seamless integration with the Firebase platform, which serves as a reliable and secure database for all your app-related data. This ensures that your information is stored safely and can be accessed from any device.

All the information is input by you, ensuring accurate and personalized data. Record when your lessons take place, top up your account, and even modify the lesson cost â€“ all within a few taps.

To enhance accuracy and effectiveness, it's currently recommended to mark lessons on the same day. While the date adjustment feature is in development, we're dedicated to implementing it in upcoming updates for your utmost convenience.
